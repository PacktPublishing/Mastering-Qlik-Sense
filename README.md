Mastering Qlik Sense is part of the Mastering series in Packt Publishing and requires you to have at least a basic understanding of Qlik Sense before working with this book. You should have either already deployed a couple of Qlik Sense apps or have worked extensively with QlikView before in case you are now looking to transition to Qlik Sense. If you are coming from a web development background, in an effort to better understand the world of Qlik Sense, some aspects of this book, with the exception of Module 3, might be too advanced for you too.

To make the most out of this book, although recommended, you don't necessarily read it from the beginning until the end, but you should feel encouraged to jump between Modules 1-3 and the chapters within them. The individual chapters, and especially modules, are written in such a way to be conclusive, meaning that they can be read individually, based on your interest. Cross-references between chapters are made to ensure you know where to continue your reading if you wish to deepen your knowledge.

To closely follow the practical examples and to make the most of the code snippets, please ensure you download the latest version of the Qlik Sense Desktop client from the official website which can be found here https://www.qlik.com/us/try-or-buy/download-qlik-sense.

For the coding parts, an advanced text editor is recommended for your use, such as sublime (https://www.sublimetext.com/) or notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). And please, if you can, do use Google Chrome!
